# Travel Agency API

## Introduction
This is a Laravel-based API application designed for a travel agency. The application allows for the management of travels and tours, with a clear distinction between these two entities. A travel represents a general trip (e.g., "Japan: Road to Wonder"), while a tour specifies the details, such as dates and pricing, for a particular instance of that travel.

## Glossary
- **Travel**: The main unit of the project, representing a trip with all necessary information like the number of days, images, and title (e.g., "Japan: Road to Wonder").
- **Tour**: A specific date range of a travel with its own price and details. For example, "Japan: Road to Wonder" might have a tour from May 10th to 27th at €1899, and another from September 10th to 15th at €669.

## Project Goals
The project provides the following functionalities:

1. **User Management**:
    - **Admin Endpoint**: Create new users. This could be implemented as a private API endpoint or an Artisan command.

2. **Travel Management**:
    - **Admin Endpoint**: Create new travels.
    - **Editor Endpoint**: Update existing travels.

3. **Tour Management**:
    - **Admin Endpoint**: Create new tours associated with travel.

4. **Public Endpoints**:
    - **Public Endpoint**: Retrieve a paginated list of public travels.
    - **Public Endpoint**: Retrieve a paginated list of tours for specific travel by its slug, with filtering options for price and date, and sorting by price or start date.

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Roles**:
    - **Admin**: Can create users, travels, and tours.
    - **Editor**: Can update travels.
    - **Public**: No authentication required to view travels and tours.

- **Notes**:
    - Every admin user also has the editor role.
    - Native Laravel authentication is utilized.
    - UUIDs are used as primary keys instead of incremental IDs (optional but recommended).

## Technical Details
- **Tour Prices**: Stored as integers multiplied by 100 (e.g., €999 is stored as 99900) and formatted when returned via API.
- **Endpoints**:
    - **Single Resource Creation**: Each creation endpoint creates only one resource per request (e.g., no arrays of resources allowed).

- **Code Quality**:
    - Enforced through tools like `php-cs-fixer` and `larastan`.
    - Feature tests are included to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Documentation
Comprehensive API documentation is provided, detailing each endpoint, its parameters, and the expected responses.

## Testing
Feature tests are implemented to verify the functionality of the application. These tests cover all major features, ensuring that the API behaves as expected.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rashaatta/travel-api.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Generate an application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. Run the migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. (Optional) Seed the database:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

7. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

## Usage
### Creating Users
Admin users can be created either through an API endpoint or via an Artisan command.

### Creating Travels and Tours
Admin users can create travels and associated tours using the respective private endpoints.

### Accessing Public Data
Public users can retrieve a list of travels and tours without authentication, with options to filter and sort the data.

## Conclusion
This application provides a robust foundation for managing travels and tours for a travel, with clear roles and responsibilities for different types of users. It adheres to best practices in Laravel development, including the use of UUIDs, code quality tools, and comprehensive testing.
